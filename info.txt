This is where I'm housing all of my code for my untitled space shooter game.

This project first came be after watching a Udemy tutorial a couple of years ago on Udemy, which can be accessed here:
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-game-development-with-unity/

I recently dug through my old Unity projects and found this, and figured maybe I can build upon it more than what I was taught in the course.
