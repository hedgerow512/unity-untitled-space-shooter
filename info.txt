Untitled Space Shooter,
v0.0.1

I recently dug through my old Unity projects and found this, and figured maybe I can build upon it more than what I was taught in the course.

This is where I'm housing all of my code for my untitled space shooter game. You can play it here:

This project first came be after watching a Udemy tutorial a couple of years ago on Udemy, which can be accessed here:
